    'Most reporting tools require hours of manual pulling, pasting, and formatting. That wastes valuable time every week.',
    'Smart dashboards remove that friction. They plug into your existing stack, automatically fetch key metrics, and present them in a way that actually drives decisions.',
    'Instead of static charts, you get living reports — updated in real time, filtered per user, and prioritized based on what your team cares about most.',
    'The result? Less time building reports. More time acting on them.',
